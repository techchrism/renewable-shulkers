# RenewableShulkers
A simple Spigot plugin to add 1.17 (20w45a) renewable shulker functionality to 1.16 and below.

When a shulker box is hit with a shulker bullet, it will try to teleport.
If it teleports, there is a chance (depending on the number of nearby shulkers) that it will spawn a new shulker in the location it teleported from.
